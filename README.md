# Weather-Satellite-Image-Station
Scripts and programs to automate the reception and processing of weather satellite signals using a RaspberryPi, SDR, and an antenna. Many of the scripts are heavily modifed versions of haslettj's instructables.

The software is dependent on the following external programs: rtl_fm, meteor_demod, medet_arm, and wxtoimg.
